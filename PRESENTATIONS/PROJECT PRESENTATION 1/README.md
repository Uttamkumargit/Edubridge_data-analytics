# FEATURES OF NUMPY ARRAY 

# 1. It contains tools for integrating code from C/C++ and Fortran:
  
-> We can use the functions in NumPy to work with code written in other languages. We can hence integrate the functionalities available in various programming
    languages. This helps implement inter-platform functions
-> A tool called Instant can be used to put C or C++ code inline in Python code and get automatically compiled as an extension library, much in the same way as
   F2PY does.
-> F2PY is a tool that provides an easy connection between Python and Fortran languages.

# 2. It consists of broadcasting functions:

-> It is a method of Numpy that allow us to the arithmetic operation on array of different shape and size.

# Rules:
-> size of each dimension should be same.
-> size of one of the dimension should be 1.

# 3. 2.It consists of broadcasting functions:

-> We can work with arrays of different data types. We can use the dtype function to determine the data type and hence get a clear idea about the available data set.
